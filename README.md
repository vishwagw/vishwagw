I'm an AI and autonomous systems researcher, entrepreneur and enthusiast with nearly two years of experience developing innovative solutions in unmanned vehicle systems, computer vision, and AI-powered assistants. My work spans autonomous drones with real-time obstacle avoidance and precision landing, smart home automation with voice-interactive AI assistants, and advanced applications like facial recognition, emotion detection, and reinforcement learning.

Alongside hands-on development, I co-founded and currently run two AI startups focused on unmanned vehicle systems and intelligent home assistant solutions, aiming to deliver next-generation automation and AI experiences.

In addition to building AI-driven hardware and software solutions, I share my insights through AI-focused blog articles, making complex topics accessible to a broader audience. My passion lies in combining creativity and technology to build intelligent, human-centric solutions that push the boundaries of what’s possible.

I am always eager to collaborate on groundbreaking AI and robotics projects, explore emerging technologies, and contribute to the future of autonomous systems.
